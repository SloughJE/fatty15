## Fatty15: Better than Everything

:::{.smaller2}

"C15:0 is emerging as the first essential fatty acid to be discovered in over 90 years."

"100+ peer-reviewed studies have been published by independent scientists throughout the world on the benefits of C15:0, including the pure C15:0 ingredient in fatty15."

"C15:0 is a pleiotropic nutrient with multiple dose-dependent mechanisms of action."

"Cellular Fragility Syndrome"

"Evidence of a nutritional C15:0 deficiency - that's fixable."

"Clinical Trial Results: Fatty15 Can Treat Nutritional C15:0 Deficiencies"

"C15:0 helps support and balance mood"

"C15:0 helps support healthy cells by targeting key hallmarks of aging"

Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) is a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designation that a chemical or substance added to food is considered safe by experts under the conditions of its intended use.

- GRAS Notification program: Submit to FDA detailing ingredient. FDA evaluates and issues a "no questions letter" or concerns. 

GRAS determinations focus on general safety for the broader population under intended use—not for specific or sensitive subgroups like pregnant or nursing individuals.


"fatty15 is safe for pregnant women and nursing moms." This is not what GRAS says. 
GRAS ≠ Automatically Safe for Pregnant or Nursing moms.

"Bottom line"
- they self-affirmed fatty15 is safe. And didn't even submit to FDA. Overstating what it means and how it was done.

<br>
<br>
"Fatty15 repairs **2.5x** more cell types compared to **omega-3**."
<br>
<br>
"Fatty15 had 36+ cellular benefits across 83% of cell types tested, which was **3x** better than **omega-3**."

- **3× better than omega-3?**
  - C15:0 showed 36 annotated, dose-dependent activities (ie at multiple doses)
  - 12 activities were shared between C15:0 and EPA at **17 μM**

:::{.notes}

- undermining decades of omega3 research in one study
- biased?
- overhyped?
- all based on thresholds chosen. 
- same dosing concentrations for both, problem? who knows.
- no indication that these doses/concentrations have any relevance to what cells would see in humans by taking EPA 
- both are absorbed differently in humans. 
- No clinical endpoints. Who knows if will play out.
- will any of this be borne out in humans? 

All their claims seem to be based on this one study. 

OMEGA-3 in marketing, but study was on EPA only.

"Given the growing and repeated evidence of C15:0 as a beneficial odd-chain saturated fatty acid, there is a need to reevaluate current nutritional guidelines that continue to recommend lowered intake of all dietary saturated fats."


Rounding?: Use the 35 “differentiating” readouts vs 12 shared at 17 μM → 35/12 ≈ 2.9, round to “3×.” But “differentiating” just means the responses weren’t the same (one changed, the other didn’t, or opposite directions)—not “better,” and some diffs could favor EPA.

### Take Fatty15 instead of omega-3 / EPA

_Note: This is a scientific/consumer-protection opinion, not medical advice or an allegation of unlawful conduct._

:::
:::{.incremental}

- **Unsupported substitution claim.** There are **no human or animal randomized trials** showing C15:0 is superior to EPA/DHA on clinical outcomes; the "3×" claim comes from unreproducible math from a **single company-affiliated in-vitro screen** rather than outcome trials.  
  [fatty15 “3×” marketing](https://fatty15.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorC0ZEsnTrOClIF9nP91wtQIywqZrbP8Tq_QNDTJ6vEwhD7n55O), [PLOS ONE in-vitro paper + competing-interest statement](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268778)

- **Contrary to major guideline recommendations.** Major authorities advise **obtaining EPA/DHA** because ALA conversion is limited and fish intake (or Rx EPA) lowers risk in specific populations; telling consumers to replace omega-3s **runs counter to that guidance**.  
  [NIH ODS Omega-3 fact sheet](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/), [AHA fish/EPA-DHA guidance](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/fish-and-omega-3-fatty-acids)

- **Potential for consumer harm.** Substitution could **dissuade** people, especially higher-risk patients, from nutrients and therapies with outcome data (e.g., **icosapent ethyl** reduces CV events when added to statins).
  [NEJM REDUCE-IT trial](https://www.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/NEJMoa1812792), [FDA label icosapent ethyl](https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2019/202057s035lbl.pdf)

- **Essential nutrient substitution risk.** Omega-3 fatty acids (ALA, with EPA/DHA in practice) are **essential nutrients** with unique roles in neurodevelopment, vision, cardiometabolic health, and mental health. Promoting C15:0 as a **replacement** implies it can substitute for these essential functions, which is unsupported and potentially harmful, especially for developing children and pregnant women.

- **Inadequate substantiation for a comparative health claim.** Under **FTC** standards, comparative efficacy claims require **“competent and reliable scientific evidence”**, typically well-controlled human studies. An in-vitro screen doesn’t meet that bar.  
  [FTC Health Products Compliance Guidance](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/health-products-compliance-guidance)

- **Conflicts of interest / non-independence.** The in-vitro “3×” paper is authored by **company-affiliated inventors** with licensed patents; it is **not independent** and has not been replicated in clinical trials. [PLOS ONE competing-interest statement](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268778)

- **Over-extrapolation from cell assays.** **Cell-panel biomarker differences ≠ clinical benefits** in people; dose/exposure relevance and translation are unproven for the claimed endpoints. [PLOS ONE methods/limitations](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268778)

:::
:::{.incremental}

- **In my view: borderline unethical.** Promoting **replacement** of EPA/DHA with C15:0 **without independent, head-to-head human evidence** and **against consensus nutrition guidance** risks **misleading consumers** about proven omega-3 benefits.

<br>

:::{.fragment}

> "Yes, there are a growing number of clinical trials supporting C15:0 and fatty15's health benefits.     
Here’s a breakdown of the six clinical trials and seven studies to date:"

:::
:::


---

### Clinical Trial 1

:::{.smaller}

:::{.fragment}

> "[Stallings et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4350154/) led a clinical trial with healthy humans to determine the oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of pure C15:0, the same ingredient provided in fatty15."


:::

<br>
<br>

:::{.fragment}

> "Participants were provided a single oral dose of C15:0 and showed that circulating C15:0 levels reliably increased.<br>**For every 100 mg of ingested pure free fatty acid C15:0, C15:0 circulating levels increased on average by 1 ug/ml.**"

:::


:::

:::{.notes}
 
1. Not true. 

"Objective: A Malabsorption Blood Test (MBT) is proposed as an alternative method to the 72-hour stool and dietary collection for assessing the degree of fat malabsoption in peaple with pancreatic insufficiency."

The purpose was to evaluate whether the MBT could detect fat malabsorption in healthy subjects (using Orlistat to inhibit pancreatic lipase) and in cystic fibrosis patients with pancreatic insufficiency.

2. Not true. This was not a C15:0 dose-response/bioavailability study. They gave participants one 2.5 gram dose (very high) of C15. Nothing about dose response.

"The MBT consists of a simultaneous oral dose of pentadecanoic acid (PA)… and triheptadecanoic acid (THA)… The aim of this study is to demonstrate the ability of MBT to detect fat malabsorption …”


"Materials and methods: The MBT with the PA and THA were delivered in a breakfast test meal (2.5 g PA and either 5g or 8 g THA)"

:::

---

### Clinical Trial 2

:::{.smaller}

:::{.fragment}

> "[Mascarenhas et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25689042/) then led a clinical trial...to extensively model the oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of pure C15:0"

:::

<br>

:::{.fragment}

> "...repeated findings from the Stallings et al. study. Namely, that <br>**for every 100 mg of ingested pure free fatty acid C15:0, circulating C15:0 levels increased on average by 1 ug/ml.**"

:::

<br>

:::{.fragment}

> "The authors concluded that pure free fatty acid C15:0 is, on average, **100% bioavailable**."

:::

:::

:::{.notes}

1. Not true. Or at least it is a huge leap from what the study actually did.

Study quote: "The aim of this study was to construct a population model to describe HA and PA pharmacokinetics (PK) after MBT administration." It's about validating the MBT.

2. This is not true. They never modeled this. This is not in the study.

And note:

"Participants consumed the MBT 8-ounce test meal… **2.5 or 5.0** g of PA" (PA is C15:0). 2 dose amounts! GRAMS! 

3. 100% bioavailable? What? That is only possible with injection. It is literally ridiculous. 100% bioavailable ON AVERAGE? 

Study quote: "The PA bioavailability estimate of 1.07 (95%CI, 0.827, 1.42) for subjects with CF was similar to healthy subjects. The estimate for CF subjects administered enzymes was 0.88 (0.72, 1.09). Although 12.3% lower than in healthy subjects, the 95%CI contains the null value of 1."

IS that where they got 100%? 
This is ‘similar’ bioavailability in 2 groups. It says nothing about absolute bioavailability.


Both studies not what they say they are.

### Clinical Trial 4

:::{.smaller_table}

:::{.fragment}

[88 Chinese females](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523662859?via%3Dihub) with **NAFLD** were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3
groups for 12 wk: diet with 300mg daily C15:0 supplementation (n = 31), diet without C15:0 supplementation (n = 28), or control (habitual diet and no C15:0 supplementation, n = 29). Treatment diet was Asian-adapted Mediterranean diet.

:::
:::

:::{.smaller2}

:::{.fragment}

> "While all three groups had lowered liver fat and body weight loss, the C15:0 supplemented group **trended** to having the greatest loss of liver fat and body fat. It is important to note, however, that these shared improvements among all three groups were not statistically significantly between the groups."

:::

<br>

:::{.fragment}


> "The authors conclude that C15:0 supplementation had early evidence of providing clinically relevant benefits related to **lower LDL cholesterol** and an improved gut microbiome."

:::

:::



:::{.notes}

1. they were statistically greater for both diet arms vs control, just not different between diet + C15:0 and diet – C15:0. ie seems that the diet change is the key.

"trended", well there are other metrics reported that the **non-C15:0** arm "trended" better! And they are very small 'trends'.

2. Unclear by how much more LDL was reduced, only coefficients on log scale reported, probably ~ 5 mg/dL, ie not much.

NO 'clinical relevance' of microbiome stuff. 

Conclusion: adding C15:0 (300mg daily) to a Asian-adapted Mediterranean diet doesn't appear to help. 

Did NOT find evidence that C15:0 HELPs the LIVER

300 mg daily. Not fatty15 supplement. (but other supplement presumably, mix in soy milk)

- "These findings suggest that both dietary interventions had comparable effects on anxiety and depression within the study population."


:::
:::

:::{.notes}

1. NOT a separate clinical trial. 

The original study was NOT set up to test any mental health / anxiety issues. 

Not sure why they mention the body weight thing. 

Not robust for: "Diet+C15 is better than Diet–C15 or Control on anxiety/depression." There is no between-arm inferential test to back that. Even the manuscript states it cannot conclude a C15:0 effect on symptoms.

Paired t-tests were employed to assess significant changes over time
Only within-group paired t-tests, No between-group modeling of change.

Do the claims live up to the modeling?
Not for incremental treatment effects. Paired t-tests address within-arm change, which cannot establish that Diet+C15 outperformed Diet–C15 or Control.

To claim superiority (e.g., “C15:0 improved anxiety beyond diet”), you must test between-arm differences in change (ANCOVA on post-score with baseline covariate, or a mixed model with Group×Time interaction). They didn’t.

Symptoms declined over 12 weeks in this sample across all groups.

:::

:::{.notes}

tons of tests too. Lots of ML models. 

Regardless that it's not on C15 or fatty15 supplementation, seems a highly exploratory study. 

"This study aimed to investigate the effects of high and adequate dairy intake (>4, 2–3
serving/day, respectively) on circulating fatty acids (FAs) and their associations with blood pressure (BP)"

tentative and hypothesis-generating rather than confirmatory

Participants weren’t randomized to C15:0; they were randomized to high vs adequate dairy. C15:0 was a measured biomarker, and the C15:0–cfPWV link comes from adjusted partial correlations, not an intervention with C15:0.

## Summary so far

:::{.smaller}

:::{.fragment}

Of the 6 "clinical trials supporting C15:0 or fatty15 benefits":

:::

:::{.incremental}

- Trials 1 and 2 are validating a fat malabsorption test.
- Trial 4: C15 doesn't appear to help NAFLD (even at higher dose than fatty15 recommends).
- Trial 5 is a secondary analysis of Trial 4; authors "cannot conclude" added benefit of C15:0.
- Trial 6 is not on C15 supplementation and is not a trial.
- Trial 7 C15 daily dose contains only 9mg; oil blend containing DHA, DPA, EPA. 
- All 6 are not on actual fatty15.
- Mis/Overstatements about what the cited study actually did/found. 
- Robust evidence it does anything beneficial? **Not supported**.

### Clinical Trial 3

:::{.smaller2}

:::{.fragment}

The only RCT in humans on actual on Fatty15.

:::
:::

:::{.smaller_table}

::: {.incremental}

- Study design: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 2-arm trial.
- Population: 30 young adults (ages 18–25) with overweight or obesity 
- Intervention: 200 mg of C15:0 (fatty15) daily vs. placebo for 12 weeks.
- Randomization: 20 participants assigned to C15:0 supplementation and 10 to placebo
- Primary outcome: change in plasma C15:0 concentration.
- Secondary outcomes: safety, tolerability, and exploratory measures (e.g., liver enzymes, hemoglobin, glucose, cholesterol).

:::

:::{.fragment}

Conclusions

:::
::: {.incremental}
- C15:0 supplementation significantly increased plasma C15:0 by 1.88 μg/mL compared to placebo. 
- Treatment was safe and well tolerated.
- Main secondary analysis: GGT increased by ~10 U/L in placebo but decreased by ~1 U/L in treatment, giving a significant between-group difference of ~11 U/L (interpret cautiously)
- In subgroup analysis of the secondary outcomes:
  - "significantly greater decreases in alanine aminotransferase (-29 U/L, P = 0.001) and aspartate aminotransferase (-6 U/L, P = 0.014), as well as a greater increase in hemoglobin (0.60 g/dL, P = 0.010), as compared with participants that did not reach a posttreatment level >5 μg/mL"

:::

:::{.notes}

RCT,  200 mg C15:0 or placebo daily, 20 c:15, 10, placebo., overweight / obese young adults

1. comparing raising C15 levels to those 2 studies is apples to oranges. 

- Different timescale: hours (PK spike) vs. months (steady-state).
- Different metric: peak concentration? (Cmax) vs. baseline shift.
- Different physiology: acute absorption vs. long-term balance of absorption, incorporation into membranes, metabolism, and turnover.
- Different doses: grams vs. milligrams.

Mis-citation of Mascarenhas/Stallings: those papers are MBT pharmacokinetic tests using grams of pentadecanoic acid as a tracer (e.g., 2.5 g PA), not a 12-week 200 mg/day supplementation. They don’t justify “200 mg → +2.3 µg/mL.”

Unreported “+2.3 µg/mL” figure: the RCT reports a +1.88 µg/mL vs placebo mean increase after 12 weeks. It does not report a 2.3 µg/mL rise “among adherers.”

### C15:0 Plasma Level Increase




::: {.smaller_table}

### Liver Function in Threshold Group

- Reframing the threshold group as "participants who adhered to the protocol".

ALT: regression to the mean in the threshold group?
outliers driving things (somewhat dealt with in statistical model later)

AST: same?

Are we just instead picking people who happened to have higher liver enzymes at the start?
ie people in the 'sub-threshold', except one, generally have better liver enzymes than Threshold group, AND placebo.

Remember, BASELINE matters!

we're down to 10/10/9 people in groups. Getting squirrely.

### Three Group Kruskal–Wallis Test


::: {.smaller_table}

:::{.fragment}

Study Abstract: 

> "Half of the participants in the treatment group had a posttreatment C15:0 level >5 μg/mL. In these individuals, there were significantly greater decreases in alanine aminotransferase (−29 U/L, P = 0.001) and aspartate aminotransferase (−6 U/L, P = 0.014), as well as a greater increase in hemoglobin (0.60 g/dL, P = 0.010), as compared with participants that did not reach a posttreatment level >5 μg/mL."

:::
:::{.incremental}
- P-values come from the three-group Kruskal–Wallis (KW) test
- Three-group KW test only answers: "Are **any** of the three groups different?", **not which** groups differ.
- *"as compared with participants that did not reach >5 μg/mL"*: reads like a **specific two-group comparison** (≥5 μg/mL **vs** <5 μg/mL). The KW test alone does **not** test that claim.
- You cannot just get a significant KW p-value, **look at medians** and declare "significantly greater decreases/increases in this group." 
- Would need **follow-up two-group test** for the exact comparison of interest.
- KW is based on ranks and can reflect differences in spread or tails, not just medians. 
- The test is NOT adjusted for baseline levels of the groups.

:::

:::

::: {.notes}

BASELINE is not taken into account in the KW test. it's on change scores! 

Why KW? small N, common test for that without assuming specific distribution, also deals with outliers.

in other words, look at the Table 3, AST, that AST p-value of 0.014, could be just due to the sub threshold group vs threshold, and you could read this as C:15 will improve AST in half who take it.
to be clear, for AST, we don’t know if the significant p-value is due to the difference between the Threshold vs Placebo group, or the Threshold vs Subthreshold group. 
If the significance is due to Threshold vs Subthreshold, that’d be weird, no? maybe baseline imbalance, just outlier, change?

### fatty15 on the Skeptics

::: {.smaller2}

**What the skeptics say**

::: {.fragment}

> In videos, skeptics go over two clinical trials (Robinson et al. and Chooi et al.) and incorrectly conclude that these trials were not in relevant populations and did not demonstrate efficacy. 

:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}

> Strangely, the skeptics made these statements while showing the papers' abstracts, where the authors themselves concluded that C15:0 demonstrated promising results.<br>

:::

<br>


::: {.fragment}

> The skeptics do not mention any of the other five studies and four clinical trials provided above, in part because two are recent publications.

:::

:::

::: {.notes}

Maybe they don't mention them because the first 2 are not about C15:0 or fatty15, 5th literally states nothing to see here, 6th is about high vs adequate dairy diets (that happen to contain C15), 7th is weak study on skin, which probably isn't due to C15.

  **Not supported:** Not a recognized medical diagnosis (absent from [ICD-11](https://icd.who.int/), not a [MeSH](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/) descriptor). The term is introduced by company-affiliated authors in a single hypothesis/review and amplified in marketing/press; there is **no independent clinical validation or diagnostic criteria**. See the hypothesis paper ([Venn-Watson 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39057678/)), company blog ([fatty15](https://fatty15.com/blogs/news/cellular-fragility-syndrome-a-deep-dive-on-nutritional-c15-0-deficiencies-and-how-to-fix-them)), and third-party critique ([CSPI](https://www.cspi.org/article/fatty15-worth-hype)).

- **Metabolic health (PPAR-α/δ, AMPK, mitochondria)**  
  **Not supported (human RCTs):** 12-wk placebo-controlled trials raised blood C15:0 but **no between-group improvements** in clinical endpoints except small LDL decrease (1/37), and very very weak "subgroup" analysis for lower AST/ALT.

  Source: [J Nutr RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39069269/)

- **Immune health / inflammation (cytokines, CRP)**  
  **Not supported (human):** No human RCT showing reductions; both human RCTs showed **no difference in CRP** in C15 group.  

- **Cognitive & mental health (dopamine/PPAR; mood/stress)**  
  **Insufficient (human):** No human trials located; claims are marketing. RCT they claim supports this (not RCT, secondary anlaysis of RCT), authors state "The present study cannot conclude that the group receiving C+15:0 together with the MD had effects in decreasing symptoms."

- **"Reduces mTOR" (longevity mechanism)**  
  **Not supported (human):** Based on mechanistic/cell work, not human outcomes.  
  Sources: [Company mTOR blog](https://fatty15.com/blogs/news/what-it-mtor-link-to-longevity), [Review asserting AMPK↑/mTOR↓](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10649853/) is written by author and of questionable relevance.

- **"3× more cellular benefits than EPA (omega-3)" / "take fatty15 instead of omega-3"**  
  **Not supported (human); potentially misleading—arguably *borderline unethical*.** The "3×" figure comes incorrect math from a single **in-vitro** screen by company-affiliated authors; there are NO **human RCTs** or animal RCTs showing clinical superiority over EPA. Substitution messaging (implying you should take fatty15 **instead of** omega-3) conflicts with established recommendations that EPA/DHA remain important nutrients. Comparative health claims promoting substitution away from EPA/DHA **conflicts with consensus guidance** and, without competent and reliable human evidence, should be backed by **competent and reliable scientific evidence**, typically well-controlled human trials—which is not present here, a concern under [FTC health-claims standards](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Health-Products-Compliance-Guidance.pdf).
