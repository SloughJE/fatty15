### Fatty15: Better than Everything

:::{.smaller2}

"100+ peer-reviewed studies have been published by independent scientists throughout the world on the benefits of C15:0, including the pure C15:0 ingredient in fatty15."

"C15:0 is emerging as the first essential fatty acid to be discovered in over 90 years."

"C15:0 is a pleiotropic nutrient with multiple dose-dependent mechanisms of action."

"An estimated 1 in 3 people may have Cellular Fragility Syndrome."

"Fatty15 fixes C15:0 deficiencies & reverses Cellular Fragility Syndrome"

"Clinical Trial Results: Fatty15 Can Treat Nutritional C15:0 Deficiencies"

"lower inflammation, and repair mitochondrial function"

"C15:0 helps support and balance mood"

"C15:0 helps support healthy cells by targeting key hallmarks of aging"

"helps support your metabolism and healthy weight on a cellular level"

"The Longevity Nutrient" "fatty15 has emerged as a leading longevity-extending geroprotector"

### Quick Definitions

:::{.smaller2}

:::{.incremental}

- Fat
  - One of the three main nutrients in food (with protein and carbohydrate). 
  - Fats are made of fatty acids and glycerol.
  
- Fatty Acid
  - Components of fat. Made of a chain of carbon atoms with hydrogen attached.
  - Different fatty acids give fats their properties (solid or liquid at room temperature).

- Saturated Fat
  - Fat made mostly of saturated fatty acids (no double bonds in carbon chain)
  - Solid at room temperature. Found in butter, cheese, meat, some tropical oils

- C15:0 (also called C15, pentadecanoic acid, or **fatty15**)
  - A specific type of saturated fatty acid with 15 carbon atoms.
  - fatty15 = C15:0

- C17:0: similar as above, but 17 carbons.

### Sources of C15 / C17

:::{.smaller2}

:::{.incremental}

- Exogenous (diet)
- C15 stronger dietary biomarker for dairy intake
- Endogenous / microbial fermentation
  - both, but stronger for c15
- Vegans show detectable levels of both

### The fatty15 Origin Story

[After analyzing thousands of samples collected over the span of about 50 years, Venn-Watson and her team were able to determine what the healthiest aging dolphins had in common. <br>“We thought it was going to be omega-3′s, because all they eat are fish.<br>And instead, it was C15:0, a saturated fatty acid I had never heard of,” she says.](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/24/longevity-nutrient-1-food-this-doctor-always-eats-to-get-enough-of-it.html) - Published May 24, 2025

- study Dolphin omega-3 intake went from 81 GRAMS to 60 grams.
- NOT transferable to humans.
- C15 is just indicative of the different diet. 

> ["Back in 2015, our co-founder and veterinary epidemiologist, Dr. Steph Venn-Watson, was searching for which nutrients in an all-fish diet helped super-smart dolphins live their longest, healthiest lives possible.<br>While Steph and her team thought omega-3s would certainly be on top of the healthy-nutrients-from-fish list, an advanced technology called metabolomics revealed that the healthiest nutrient in fish appeared to be C15:0, which is an odd-chain saturated fatty acid. Unexpectedly, omega-3s did not make the list."](https://fatty15.com/blogs/news/we-can-be-better-the-why-behind-fatty15-s-latest-ad-campaign)

**The Pivot to C15**

- **Nov 28, 2019** Pivot to **C15:0** — **US 2019/0358183 A1** publishes: **broadens to odd-chain FAs incl. C15:0**; frames **planned supplement/food ingredient** uses (first public C15 pivot appears **in IP**) ([Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20190358183A1/en)).

**C15 is Essential and Product Launch (same day publish/product launch)**

- **May 18, 2020** — *Scientific Reports* paper (founder-led) states C15:0 “potentially essential” (animal/cell work)  [[Sci. Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64960-y)]<br>same-day **launch PR** positioning C15:0 as “new essential FA”, fundraising, & fall 2020 supplement plan [[PR Newswire](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seraphina-therapeutics-introduces-newly-discovered-potential-essential-saturated-fatty-acid-present-in-butter-301060418.html); trade press [[C&EN](https://cen.acs.org/business/start-ups/Seraphina-launches-new-fatty-acid/98/i20)]].

- **Jun 24, 2021** — **GRAS** status for FA15 (C15:0 ingredient) announced (opens **food** channel) [[Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210624005920/en/Seraphina-Therapeutics-Hits-Significant-Regulatory-Milestone-Earning-GRAS-Status-for-FA15)], [[FoodDive](https://www.fooddive.com/news/seraphina-therapeutics-fatty-acid-powder-gains-gras-status/602238/)].

- **Sep 14, 2021** — Patent on **C15:0 human dosing/uses** granted (commercial dosing claims) [[US 11,116,740](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11116740B2/en)].

:::
:::

:::{.notes}

- Pre-2020 literature: C17:0 looks partly endogenous, making “deficiency/essential” claims weak; C15:0 less so → easier to frame as “missing.”
- Early science/IP were C17-centric; by 2019 the filings pivot to C15 with explicit supplement language.
- C15 fits the marketing: more plausibly “essential,” clean pill narrative; C17 doesn’t.
- The 2020 metabolomics emphasis on C15 landed after the pivot—reads like post-hoc justification.
- No smoking-gun memo, but the timeline + COIs strongly suggest a commercially driven C17→C15 switch.

:::{.notes}

Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) is a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) designation that a chemical or substance added to food is considered safe by experts under the conditions of its intended use.

- Any substance that is a 'food-additive' and you modify it 

- generally most isolated supplements

- GRAS Notification program: Submit to FDA detailing ingredient. FDA evaluates and issues a "no questions letter" or concerns. 

GRAS determinations focus on general safety for the broader population under intended use—not for specific or sensitive subgroups like pregnant or nursing individuals.


"fatty15 is safe for pregnant women and nursing moms." This is not what GRAS says. 
GRAS ≠ Automatically Safe for Pregnant or Nursing moms.

"Bottom line"
- they self-affirmed fatty15 is safe. And didn't even submit to FDA. Overstating what it means and how it was done.

### Fatty15: 3x better than omega-3

[Deep Dive: Fatty15 vs. Omega-3](https://fatty15.com/blogs/news/deep-dive-fatty15-vs-omega-3-study); [The Science](https://fatty15.com/pages/the-science)

:::{.fragment}

> "Simply put, fatty15 is better, broader and safer than the purest, highest performing omega-3 (EPA) in repairing and restoring cellular (aka your) health."
<br>
<br>
"Fatty15 repairs **2.5x** more cell types compared to **omega-3**."
<br>
<br>
"Fatty15 had 36+ cellular benefits across 83% of cell types tested, which was **3x** better than **omega-3**."

:::
:::{.incremental}

- [100% in vitro (cell-based) study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268778), by founder, unclear if relevant in humans.
- **3× better than omega-3?**
  - C15:0 showed 36 annotated, dose-dependent activities (ie at multiple doses)
  - 12 activities were shared between C15:0 and EPA at **17 μM**
  - mixing a multi-dose C15:0 count with a single-dose overlap with EPA?  
- **Repairs 2.5× more cell types?** 
  - C15:0...broad anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities...across **10** systems ("repairs")
  - EPA at 50 μM was *cytotoxic* to **4** of the 12 cell systems
  - 10 / 4 ? therefore **2.5x** ?

:::

:::

:::{.notes}

- undermining decades of omega3 research in one study
- biased?
- overhyped?
- all based on thresholds chosen. 
- same dosing concentrations for both, problem? who knows.
- no indication that these doses/concentrations have any relevance to what cells would see in humans by taking EPA 
- both are absorbed differently in humans. 
- No clinical endpoints. Who knows if will play out.
- will any of this be borne out in humans? 

All their claims seem to be based on this one study. 

OMEGA-3 in marketing, but study was on EPA only.

"Given the growing and repeated evidence of C15:0 as a beneficial odd-chain saturated fatty acid, there is a need to reevaluate current nutritional guidelines that continue to recommend lowered intake of all dietary saturated fats."


Rounding?: Use the 35 “differentiating” readouts vs 12 shared at 17 μM → 35/12 ≈ 2.9, round to “3×.” But “differentiating” just means the responses weren’t the same (one changed, the other didn’t, or opposite directions)—not “better,” and some diffs could favor EPA.

- **Unsupported substitution claim.** There are **no human or animal randomized trials** showing C15:0 is superior to EPA/DHA on clinical outcomes; the "3×" claim comes from unreproducible math from a **single company-affiliated in-vitro screen** rather than outcome trials.

- **Contrary to major guideline recommendations.** Major authorities advise **obtaining EPA/DHA** because ALA conversion is limited and fish intake (or Rx EPA) lowers risk in specific populations; telling consumers to replace omega-3s **runs counter to that guidance**.

- **Potential for consumer harm.** Substitution could **dissuade** people, especially higher-risk patients, from nutrients and therapies with outcome data (e.g., **icosapent ethyl** reduces CV events when added to statins).

- **Essential nutrient substitution risk.** Omega-3 fatty acids (ALA, with EPA/DHA in practice) are **essential nutrients** with unique roles in neurodevelopment, vision, cardiometabolic health, and mental health. Promoting C15:0 as a **replacement** implies it can substitute for these essential functions, which is unsupported and potentially harmful, especially for developing children and pregnant women.

<br>

:::{.fragment}

Single, 2.5 gram acute MBT bolus; PK readouts only; no multi-dose curve; not about chronic supplementation.

1. Not true. 

"Objective: A Malabsorption Blood Test (MBT) is proposed as an alternative method to the 72-hour stool and dietary collection for assessing the degree of fat malabsoption in peaple with pancreatic insufficiency."

The purpose was to evaluate whether the MBT could detect fat malabsorption in healthy subjects (using Orlistat to inhibit pancreatic lipase) and in cystic fibrosis patients with pancreatic insufficiency.

2. Not true. This was not a C15:0 dose-response/bioavailability study. They gave participants one 2.5 gram dose (very high) of C15. Nothing about dose response.

"The MBT consists of a simultaneous oral dose of pentadecanoic acid (PA)… and triheptadecanoic acid (THA)… The aim of this study is to demonstrate the ability of MBT to detect fat malabsorption …”


"Materials and methods: The MBT with the PA and THA were delivered in a breakfast test meal (2.5 g PA and either 5g or 8 g THA)"

"Based on pharmacokinetic data, in which every 100 mg of C15:0 ingested results in an approximate 10 µM increase in circulating C15:0, circulating C15:0 levels would decrease from 20 µM to 5 µM (an approximate decline from 0.2% to 0.05% of total fatty acids) [97,98]."

:::{.notes}

1. Not true. Or at least it is a huge leap from what the study actually did.

Study quote: "The aim of this study was to construct a population model to describe HA and PA pharmacokinetics (PK) after MBT administration." It's about validating the MBT.

2. This is not true. They never modeled this. This is not in the study.

- they did not report a per-100-mg intake conversion.
- studies’ goal was to detect fat malabsorption, not dietary intake
- 20 µM → 5 µM and 0.2% → 0.05% of total fatty acids—were not measured in these studies.
- that quote is not an accurate representation of and rests on assumptions those papers don’t justify."

And note:

"Participants consumed the MBT 8-ounce test meal… **2.5 or 5.0** g of PA" (PA is C15:0). 2 dose amounts! GRAMS! 

3. 100% bioavailable? What? That is only possible with injection. It is literally ridiculous. 100% bioavailable ON AVERAGE? 

Pure, 100% false
Study quote: "The PA bioavailability estimate of 1.07 (95%CI, 0.827, 1.42) for subjects with CF was similar to healthy subjects. The estimate for CF subjects administered enzymes was 0.88 (0.72, 1.09). Although 12.3% lower than in healthy subjects, the 95%CI contains the null value of 1."

IS that where they got 100%? 
This is ‘similar’ bioavailability in 2 groups. It says nothing about absolute bioavailability.


Both studies not what they say they are.


Stallings & Mascarenhas: acute, gram-level malabsorption test PK; they do not justify a chronic “per-100 mg → µg/mL” rule for daily supplements.

### Clinical Trial 4

:::{.smaller_table}

[88 Chinese females](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38035997/) with **NAFLD** were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3
groups for 12 wk: diet with 300mg daily C15:0 supplementation (n = 31), diet without C15:0 supplementation (n = 28), or control (habitual diet and no C15:0 supplementation, n = 29). Treatment diet was Asian-adapted Mediterranean diet.

:::

:::{.fragment}

> "While all three groups had lowered liver fat and body weight loss, the C15:0 supplemented group **trended** to having the greatest loss of liver fat and body fat. It is important to note, however, that these shared improvements among all three groups were not statistically significantly between the groups."

:::

<br>

:::{.fragment}


> "The authors conclude that C15:0 supplementation had early evidence of providing clinically relevant benefits related to **lower LDL cholesterol** and an improved gut microbiome."

:::

:::



:::{.notes}

1. they were statistically greater for both diet arms vs control, just not different between diet + C15:0 and diet – C15:0. ie seems that the diet change is the key.

"trended", well there are other metrics reported that the **non-C15:0** arm "trended" better! And they are very small 'trends'.

2. Unclear by how much more LDL was reduced, only coefficients on log scale reported, probably ~ 5 mg/dL, ie not much.

NO 'clinical relevance' of microbiome stuff. 

Conclusion: adding C15:0 (300mg daily) to a Asian-adapted Mediterranean diet doesn't appear to help. 

Did NOT find evidence that C15:0 HELPs the LIVER

300 mg daily. Not fatty15 supplement. (but other supplement presumably, mix in soy milk)

- "The present study cannot conclude that the group receiving C+15:0 together with the MD had effects in decreasing symptoms."
- "These findings suggest that both dietary interventions had comparable effects on anxiety and depression within the study population."


:::
:::

:::{.notes}

C15:0 did show the largest within-group drop in trait anxiety (d = 0.69), but the study used paired (within-group) tests only—no between-group superiority analysis, so you can’t claim C15:0 was best overall.


1. NOT a separate clinical trial. 

The original study was NOT set up to test any mental health / anxiety issues. 

Not sure why they mention the body weight thing. 

clinically “reliable change” counts within the C15:0 arm, the tables show very small numbers by subgroup (e.g., ~2 participants for state/trait anxiety and ~3 for depression among those starting in higher-symptom ranges)

In this RCT, the C15:0-supplemented group had the largest within-group drop in trait anxiety and a significant drop in state anxiety, but depressive symptoms (“mood” by BDI-II) improved in all groups and not most in the C15:0 group (the control actually had a slightly larger depression effect size than C15:0). The paper did not report between-group superiority tests and even notes it cannot conclude C15:0 caused the symptom decreases

Paired t-tests were employed to assess significant changes over time
Only within-group paired t-tests, No between-group modeling of change.

Do the claims live up to the modeling?
Not for incremental treatment effects. Paired t-tests address within-arm change, which cannot establish that Diet+C15 outperformed Diet–C15 or Control.

To claim superiority (e.g., “C15:0 improved anxiety beyond diet”), you must test between-arm differences in change (ANCOVA on post-score with baseline covariate, or a mixed model with Group×Time interaction). They didn’t.

Symptoms declined over 12 weeks in this sample across all groups.

tons of tests too. Lots of ML models. 

Regardless that it's not on C15 or fatty15 supplementation, seems a highly exploratory study. 

"This study aimed to investigate the effects of high and adequate dairy intake (>4, 2–3
serving/day, respectively) on circulating fatty acids (FAs) and their associations with blood pressure (BP)"

tentative and hypothesis-generating rather than confirmatory

Participants weren’t randomized to C15:0; they were randomized to high vs adequate dairy. C15:0 was a measured biomarker, and the C15:0–cfPWV link comes from adjusted partial correlations, not an intervention with C15:0.

## Summary so far

:::{.smaller}

:::{.fragment}

Of the 6 "clinical trials supporting C15:0 or fatty15 benefits":

:::

:::{.incremental}

- Trials 1 and 2 are validating a fat malabsorption test.
- Trial 4: C15 doesn't appear to help NAFLD (even at higher dose than fatty15 recommends).
- Trial 5 is a secondary analysis of Trial 4; authors "cannot conclude" added benefit of C15:0.
- Trial 6 is not on C15 supplementation and is not a trial.
- Trial 7 C15 daily dose contains only 9mg; oil blend containing DHA, DPA, EPA. 
- All 6 are not on actual fatty15.
- Mis/Overstatements about what the cited study actually did/found. 
- Robust evidence it does anything beneficial? **Not supported**.

# Clinical Trial 3

## Clinical Trial 3

:::{.smaller2}


The only RCT in humans on actual on Fatty15.


:::

:::{.smaller_table}

::: {.incremental}

- Study design: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, 2-arm trial.
- Population: 30 young adults (ages 18–25) with overweight or obesity 
- Intervention: 200 mg of C15:0 (fatty15) daily vs. placebo for 12 weeks.
- Randomization: 20 participants assigned to C15:0 supplementation and 10 to placebo
- Primary outcome: change in plasma C15:0 concentration.
- Secondary outcomes: safety, tolerability, and exploratory measures (e.g., liver enzymes, hemoglobin, glucose, cholesterol).

:::

:::{.fragment}

Conclusions

:::
::: {.incremental}
- C15:0 supplementation significantly increased plasma C15:0 by 1.88 μg/mL compared to placebo. 
- Treatment was safe and well tolerated.
- In subgroup analysis of the secondary outcomes:
  - "significantly greater decreases in ALT (-29 U/L, P = 0.001) and AST (-6 U/L, P = 0.014), as well as a greater increase in hemoglobin (0.60 g/dL, P = 0.010), as compared with participants that did not reach a posttreatment level >5 μg/mL"

:::


:::

:::{.notes}

2:1 assignment was generated statistically for the trial design, with the primary aim being feasibility and adequate power in this pilot.

- Main secondary analysis: GGT increased by ~10 U/L in placebo but decreased by ~1 U/L in treatment, giving a significant between-group difference of ~11 U/L (interpret cautiously)

:::{.notes}

RCT,  200 mg C15:0 or placebo daily, 20 c:15, 10, placebo., overweight / obese young adults

1. comparing raising C15 levels to those 2 studies is apples to oranges. 

- Different timescale: hours (PK spike) vs. months (steady-state).
- Different metric: peak concentration? (Cmax) vs. baseline shift.
- Different physiology: acute absorption vs. long-term balance of absorption, incorporation into membranes, metabolism, and turnover.
- Different doses: grams vs. milligrams.

Mis-citation of Mascarenhas/Stallings: those papers are MBT pharmacokinetic tests using grams of pentadecanoic acid as a tracer (e.g., 2.5 g PA), not a 12-week 200 mg/day supplementation. They don’t justify “200 mg → +2.3 µg/mL.”

Unreported “+2.3 µg/mL” figure: the RCT reports a +1.88 µg/mL vs placebo mean increase after 12 weeks. It does not report a 2.3 µg/mL rise “among adherers.”

**Reverse logic**: Groups were formed after the study, based on *final* C15:0 levels, not on adherence.

ALT: regression to the mean in the threshold group?
outliers driving things (somewhat dealt with in statistical model later)

AST: same?

Are we just instead picking people who happened to have higher liver enzymes at the start?
ie people in the 'sub-threshold', except one, generally have better liver enzymes than Threshold group, AND placebo.

Remember, BASELINE matters!

we're down to 10/10/9 people in groups. Getting squirrely.

### Three Group Kruskal–Wallis Test


::: {.smaller_table}

:::{.fragment}

Study Abstract: 

> "Half of the participants in the treatment group had a posttreatment C15:0 level >5 μg/mL. In these individuals, there were significantly greater decreases in alanine aminotransferase (−29 U/L, P = 0.001) and aspartate aminotransferase (−6 U/L, P = 0.014), as well as a greater increase in hemoglobin (0.60 g/dL, P = 0.010), **as compared with participants that did not reach a posttreatment level >5 μg/mL**."

:::
:::{.incremental}
- P-values come from the three-group Kruskal–Wallis (KW) test
- Three-group KW test only answers: "Are **any** of the three groups different?", **not which** groups differ.
- *"as compared with participants that did not reach >5 μg/mL"*: reads like a **specific two-group comparison** (≥5 μg/mL **vs** <5 μg/mL). The KW test alone does **not** test that claim.
- You cannot just get a significant KW p-value, **look at medians** and declare "significantly greater decreases/increases in this group." 
- Would need **follow-up two-group test** for the exact comparison of interest.
- KW is based on ranks and can reflect differences in spread or tails, not just medians. 
- The test is NOT adjusted for baseline levels of the groups.

:::

:::

::: {.notes}

BASELINE is not taken into account in the KW test. it's on change scores! 

Why KW? small N, common test for that without assuming specific distribution, also deals with outliers.

in other words, look at the Table 3, AST, that AST p-value of 0.014, could be just due to the sub threshold group vs threshold, and you could read this as C:15 will improve AST in half who take it.
to be clear, for AST, we don’t know if the significant p-value is due to the difference between the Threshold vs Placebo group, or the Threshold vs Subthreshold group. 
If the significance is due to Threshold vs Subthreshold, that’d be weird, no? maybe baseline imbalance, just outlier, change?

### fatty15 on the Skeptics

::: {.smaller2}

**What the skeptics say**

::: {.fragment}

> In videos, skeptics go over two clinical trials (Robinson et al. and Chooi et al.) and incorrectly conclude that these trials were not in relevant populations and did not demonstrate efficacy. 

:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}

> Strangely, the skeptics made these statements while showing the papers' abstracts, where the authors themselves concluded that C15:0 demonstrated promising results.<br>

:::

<br>


::: {.fragment}

> The skeptics do not mention any of the other five studies and four clinical trials provided above, in part because two are recent publications.

:::

:::

::: {.notes}

Maybe they don't mention them because the first 2 are not about C15:0 or fatty15, 5th literally states nothing to see here, 6th is about high vs adequate dairy diets (that happen to contain C15), 7th is weak study on skin, which probably isn't due to C15.

:::{.smaller_table}

Still want to try fatty15?


:::{.incremental}

- '30 day' means 30 pills, and 100mg per pill. 
- Study protocol of 200mg or 300mg

:::

:::{.fragment}

To recreate the study doses:      
(based on 90 day subscription)

- $2.67 or $4.00 per day, or $80 or $120 per month

:::{.notes}


- HSA/FSA: Pre-tax accounts for IRS-defined medical expenses.
- Normally covered: Doctor visits, prescriptions, tests, devices, OTC meds.
- Supplements: Not covered unless doctor says they’re needed for a condition.
- Workaround: Get a Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN) → then eligible.
- TrueMed’s role: Online telehealth that issues LMNs for supplements like Fatty15.
- For Fatty15, they’re effectively saying: “Here’s a doctor’s note that your C15:0 supplement is medically necessary.”
- Legality: Allowed under IRS rules, but only if tied to a medical necessity letter.

### Conclusion

In my view: 

:::{.incremental}

- Some observational studies suggest C15:0 may be beneficial, but others are null (no clear association).
- No human RCT evidence supplementation is worth taking
- Impossible to decouple the business and science
- Marketing is borderline harmful and potentially false advertising
- Marketing looks like parody or satire

:::

# No New RCT Planned


:::{.notes}

in clinicialtrials.gov, where you register them, no new RCT on fatty15, C15:0, pentadecanoic acid.
Could be 1-3 years (1 is optimistic) from now if we ever see a new RCT.

RCT on fatty15 took about 3-4 years
start: 2021-07-06
Primary Completion: 2023-04-30

- **“Cellular Fragility Syndrome”**  
  **Not supported:** Not a recognized medical diagnosis (absent from [ICD-11](https://icd.who.int/), not a [MeSH](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/) descriptor). The term is introduced by company-affiliated authors in a single hypothesis/review and amplified in marketing/press; there is **no independent clinical validation or diagnostic criteria**. See the hypothesis paper ([Venn-Watson 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39057678/)), company blog ([fatty15](https://fatty15.com/blogs/news/cellular-fragility-syndrome-a-deep-dive-on-nutritional-c15-0-deficiencies-and-how-to-fix-them)), and third-party critique ([CSPI](https://www.cspi.org/article/fatty15-worth-hype)).

- **Metabolic health (PPAR-α/δ, AMPK, mitochondria)**  
  **Not supported in human RCTs:** Two 12-week placebo-controlled trials raised circulating C15:0 but showed **no improvements in metabolic outcomes** (weight, glucose, insulin resistance, triglycerides, blood pressure).
  Sources: [J Nutr RCT (2024)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39069269/)

- **Heart health (LDL; cardiometabolic risk/events)**  
  **not supported/insufficient:** No trials show fewer CVD events; observational meta-analysis shows **no association with all-cause mortality** and non-significant pooled associations for some CVD subtypes for 15:0. 12-wk placebo-controlled trial raised blood C15:0 but **no between-group improvements** in clinical endpoints except small LDL decrease (1/37) (not replicated in other RCT).
  Sources: [PLOS Med meta-analysis (2021)](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003763)

- **Liver health (enzymes; fatty liver)**  
  **Not supported (human):** 12 week human RCT trial showed no difference in liver Fat, or liver enzymes. Other lower GGT, (but not in subgroup, lower ALT/AST in subgroup). Unclear/non-replicated results.

- **Red blood cells (membranes; hemoglobin)**  
  **Not Supported (human ITT):** Hemoglobin increase seen only in **NON-RANDOM subgroup** defined after the fact, not vs placebo.  
  Source: [J Nutr RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39069269/)

- **Immune health / inflammation (cytokines, CRP)**  
  **Not supported (human):** No human RCT showing reductions; both human RCTs showed **no difference in CRP** in C15 group.  

- **Cognitive & mental health (dopamine/PPAR; mood/stress)**  
  **Insufficient (human):** No human trials located; claims are marketing. RCT they claim supports this (not RCT, secondary anlaysis of RCT), authors state "The present study cannot conclude that the group receiving C+15:0 together with the MD had effects in decreasing symptoms."

### So Many Claims:

- **Sleep quality**  
  **Not supported (human):** No C15:0 sleep RCTs; “deeper sleep” appears in marketing/surveys. RCT found no difference in sleep duration.
  Example claim: [Product page](https://fatty15.com/products/your-essential-fatty-acid)

  **Not supported (human):** Based on mechanistic/cell work, not human outcomes.  
  Sources: [Company mTOR blog](https://fatty15.com/blogs/news/what-it-mtor-link-to-longevity), [Review asserting AMPK↑/mTOR↓](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10649853/) is written by author and of questionable relevance.

- **"3× more cellular benefits than EPA (omega-3)" / "take fatty15 instead of omega-3"**  
  **Not supported (human); potentially misleading—arguably *borderline unethical*.** The "3×" figure comes incorrect math from a single **in-vitro** screen by company-affiliated authors; there are NO **human RCTs** or animal RCTs showing clinical superiority over EPA. Substitution messaging (implying you should take fatty15 **instead of** omega-3) conflicts with established recommendations that EPA/DHA remain important nutrients. Comparative health claims promoting substitution away from EPA/DHA **conflicts with consensus guidance** and, without competent and reliable human evidence, should be backed by **competent and reliable scientific evidence**, typically well-controlled human trials—which is not present here, a concern under [FTC health-claims standards](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Health-Products-Compliance-Guidance.pdf).

The NuEva study revealed significant impact of dietary patterns on fatty acid profiles, with vegans and vegetarians displaying lower concentrations of SFA and n-3 fatty acids, including EPA and DHA, compared to omnivores and flexitarians.<br>Despite the **clear differences** in **fatty acid** profiles across the diets, the **inflammatory markers** measured in our healthy collective are **comparable**."](https://lipidworld.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12944-025-02517-6)

- Odd-chain fatty acids as a biomarker for dietary fiber intake<br>[**Results**:<br>Cellulose did not affect plasma OCFA levels, whereas inulin and propionate increased pentadecanoic acid (C15:0) by ∼17% (P < 0.05) and 13% (P = 0.05), respectively. The effect on heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) was even more pronounced, because it was elevated in almost all participants by inulin (11%; P < 0.01) and propionate (13%; P < 0.001). Furthermore, cell culture experiments showed a positive association between propionate and OCFA levels (R2 = 0.99, P < 0.0001), whereas palmitate (16:0) was negatively correlated (R2 = 0.83, P = 0.004).<br>**Conclusions**:<br>Our data show that gut-derived propionate is used for the hepatic synthesis of OCFAs in humans. The association of OCFAs with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes may therefore also relate to dietary fiber intake and not only dairy fat.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28424190/)
