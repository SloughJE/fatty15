## Fatty15

:::{.smaller2}

C15:0 is emerging as the first essential fatty acid to be discovered in over 90 years.

100+ peer-reviewed studies have been published by independent scientists throughout the world on the benefits of C15:0, including the pure C15:0 ingredient in fatty15.

C15:0 is a pleiotropic nutrient with multiple dose-dependent mechanisms of action.

"#1 fastest-growing supplement company and the 5th fastest-growing Consumer Product Company in America on the Inc. 5000 list"

"Evidence of a nutritional C15:0 deficiency - that's fixable."

"Cellular Fragility Syndrome" coined by founder. 

Cellular Fragility Syndrome = not having enough C15:0 = fix it with fatty15.
- with fatty15.

GRAS determinations focus on general safety for the broader population under intended use—not for specific or sensitive subgroups like pregnant or nursing individuals.


"fatty15 is safe for pregnant women and nursing moms." This is not what GRAS says. 
GRAS ≠ Automatically Safe for Pregnant or Nursing moms.

### Fatty15: 3x better than omega-3

:::{.smaller_table}

[Deep Dive: Fatty15 vs. Omega-3](https://fatty15.com/blogs/news/deep-dive-fatty15-vs-omega-3-study)

> "Simply put, fatty15 is better, broader and safer than the purest, highest performing omega-3 (EPA) in repairing and restoring cellular (aka your) health."
<br>
<br>
"Fatty15 repairs **2.5x** more cell types compared to omega-3."
<br>
<br>
"Fatty15 had 36+ cellular benefits across 83% of cell types tested, which was **3x** better than omega-3."

:::{.incremental}

- [100% in vitro (cell-based) study](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0268778), done by founder, unclear if relevant in humans.
- **3x better?**
  - 12 vs 36? "36 annotated activities" vs "12 activities shared"? 
  - but that's shared, EPA had more. (21, but not reported, must go to supplement)
- **2.5x more?** 
  - "At 50 μM, EPA was cytotoxic to the following **four of the 12** primary human cell systems:"
  - "C15:0...36 activities in **10 of the 12** systems in the BioMAP Diversity PLUS Panel"
  - Fatty15 repaired **10/12** cell-based systems; omega-3 **4/12**; 10 / 4 ? therefore **2.5x** ?
  - Not comparable metrics. That’s mixing different denominators.

:::

:::

:::{.notes}

- undermining decades of omega3 research in one study
- biased?
- overhyped?
- all based on thresholds chosen. 
- same dosing concentrations for both, problem? who knows.
- no indication that these doses/concentrations have any relevance to what cells would see in humans by taking EPA 
- both are absorbed differently in humans. 
- No clinical endpoints. Who knows if will play out.
- will any of this be borne out in humans?

  Source: [fatty15 FAQ](https://fatty15.com/pages/faqs)

<br>

:::{.fragment}

> "Yes, there are a growing number of clinical trials supporting C15:0 and fatty15's health benefits.     
Here’s a breakdown of the six clinical trials and seven studies to date:"

:::
:::


---

### Clinical Trial 1

:::{.smaller}

:::{.fragment}

> "[Stallings et al.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4350154/) led a clinical trial with healthy humans to determine the oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of pure C15:0, the same ingredient provided in fatty15."


:::

<br>
<br>

:::{.fragment}

> "Participants were provided a single oral dose of C15:0 and showed that circulating C15:0 levels reliably increased.<br>**For every 100 mg of ingested pure free fatty acid C15:0, C15:0 circulating levels increased on average by 1 ug/ml.**"

:::


:::

:::{.notes}
 
1. Not true. 

"Objective: A Malabsorption Blood Test (MBT) is proposed as an alternative method to the 72-hour stool and dietary collection for assessing the degree of fat malabsoption in peaple with pancreatic insufficiency."

The purpose was to evaluate whether the MBT could detect fat malabsorption in healthy subjects (using Orlistat to inhibit pancreatic lipase) and in cystic fibrosis patients with pancreatic insufficiency.

2. Not true. This was not a C15:0 dose-response/bioavailability study. They gave participants one 2.5 gram dose (very high) of C15. Nothing about dose response.

"The MBT consists of a simultaneous oral dose of pentadecanoic acid (PA)… and triheptadecanoic acid (THA)… The aim of this study is to demonstrate the ability of MBT to detect fat malabsorption …”


"Materials and methods: The MBT with the PA and THA were delivered in a breakfast test meal (2.5 g PA and either 5g or 8 g THA)"

:::

---

### Clinical Trial 2

:::{.smaller}

:::{.fragment}

> "[Mascarenhas et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25689042/) then led a clinical trial...to extensively model the oral bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of pure C15:0"

:::

<br>

:::{.fragment}

> "...repeated findings from the Stallings et al. study. Namely, that <br>**for every 100 mg of ingested pure free fatty acid C15:0, circulating C15:0 levels increased on average by 1 ug/ml.**"

:::

<br>

:::{.fragment}

> "The authors concluded that pure free fatty acid C15:0 is, on average, **100% bioavailable**."

:::

:::

:::{.notes}

1. Not true. Or at least it is a huge leap from what the study actually did.

Study quote: "The aim of this study was to construct a population model to describe HA and PA pharmacokinetics (PK) after MBT administration." It's about validating the MBT.

2. This is not true. They never modeled this. This is not in the study.

And note:

"Participants consumed the MBT 8-ounce test meal… **2.5 or 5.0** g of PA" (PA is C15:0). 2 dose amounts! GRAMS! 

3. 100% bioavailable? What? That is only possible with injection. It is literally ridiculous. 100% bioavailable ON AVERAGE? 

Study quote: "The PA bioavailability estimate of 1.07 (95%CI, 0.827, 1.42) for subjects with CF was similar to healthy subjects. The estimate for CF subjects administered enzymes was 0.88 (0.72, 1.09). Although 12.3% lower than in healthy subjects, the 95%CI contains the null value of 1."

IS that where they got 100%? 
This is ‘similar’ bioavailability in 2 groups. It says nothing about absolute bioavailability.


Both studies not what they say they are.

### Clinical Trial 4

:::{.smaller_table}

:::{.fragment}

[88 Chinese females](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523662859?via%3Dihub) with **NAFLD** were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3
groups for 12 wk: diet with C15:0 supplementation (n = 31), diet without C15:0 supplementation (n = 28), or control (habitual diet and no C15:0 supplementation, n = 29). Treatment diet was Asian-adapted Mediterranean diet.

:::
:::

:::{.smaller2}

:::{.fragment}

> "While all three groups had lowered liver fat and body weight loss, the C15:0 supplemented group **trended** to having the greatest loss of liver fat and body fat. It is important to note, however, that these shared improvements among all three groups were not statistically significantly between the groups."

:::

<br>

:::{.fragment}


> "The authors conclude that C15:0 supplementation had early evidence of providing clinically relevant benefits related to **lower LDL cholesterol** and an improved gut microbiome."

:::

:::



:::{.notes}

1. they were statistically greater for both diet arms vs control, just not different between diet + C15:0 and diet – C15:0. ie seems that the diet change is the key.

"trended", well there are other metrics reported that the **non-C15:0** arm "trended" better! And they are very small 'trends'.

2. Unclear by how much more LDL was reduced, only coefficients on log scale reported, probably ~ 5 mg/dL, ie not much.

NO 'clinical relevance' of microbiome stuff. 

Conclusion: adding C15:0 (300mg daily) to a Asian-adapted Mediterranean diet doesn't appear to help. 

Did NOT find evidence that C15:0 HELPs the LIVER

300 mg daily. Not fatty15 supplement. (but other supplement presumably, mix in soy milk)

- "The present study cannot conclude that the group receiving C+15:0 together with the MD had effects in decreasing symptoms."
- "These findings suggest that both dietary interventions had comparable effects on anxiety and depression within the study population."


:::
:::

:::{.notes}

1. NOT a separate clinical trial. 

The original study was NOT set up to test any mental health / anxiety issues. 

Not sure why they mention the body weight thing. 

Not robust for: "Diet+C15 is better than Diet–C15 or Control on anxiety/depression." There is no between-arm inferential test to back that. Even the manuscript states it cannot conclude a C15:0 effect on symptoms.

Paired t-tests were employed to assess significant changes over time
Only within-group paired t-tests, No between-group modeling of change.

Do the claims live up to the modeling?
Not for incremental treatment effects. Paired t-tests address within-arm change, which cannot establish that Diet+C15 outperformed Diet–C15 or Control.

To claim superiority (e.g., “C15:0 improved anxiety beyond diet”), you must test between-arm differences in change (ANCOVA on post-score with baseline covariate, or a mixed model with Group×Time interaction). They didn’t.

Symptoms declined over 12 weeks in this sample across all groups.

### Clinical Trial 6

Original RCT - "Objective: The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the impact of high dairy product intake (HD) (≥4 servings/d) for 6 wk, compared with an adequate dairy product intake (AD) (≤2 servings/d), on glycemic and insulinemic parameters, insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and β-cell function in hyperinsulinemic adults."


:::


:::

:::{.notes}

tons of tests too. Lots of ML models. 

Regardless that it's not on C15 or fatty15 supplementation, seems a highly exploratory study. 

"This study aimed to investigate the effects of high and adequate dairy intake (>4, 2–3
serving/day, respectively) on circulating fatty acids (FAs) and their associations with blood pressure (BP)"

tentative and hypothesis-generating rather than confirmatory

Participants weren’t randomized to C15:0; they were randomized to high vs adequate dairy. C15:0 was a measured biomarker, and the C15:0–cfPWV link comes from adjusted partial correlations, not an intervention with C15:0.

really fragile statistics. Lots of simple t-tests on change scores, tons of tests, no multiplicity correction. 

Wasn’t just C15:0, was an oil containing C:15 but also many other fatty acids like DHA, DPA..etc. 

ONLY ~9 MG C15. so it’s probably the other stuff.

## Summary so far

:::{.smaller}

:::{.fragment}

Of the 6 "clinical trials supporting C15:0 or fatty15 benefits":

:::

:::{.incremental}

1. No clinical trial on actual fatty15.
2. Literal making up of what the study did. 
3. A secondary analysis on an RCT is not an RCT.

5. Almost ZERO evidence it does anything.

:::

:::{.notes}

RCT,  200 mg C15:0 or placebo daily, 20 c:15, 10, placebo., overweight / obese young adults

1. The paper never says participants were purposefully avoiding whole-fat dairy. Exclusion criteria was high habitual C15:0 intake (>250 mg/day) by FFQ, nothing about "purposefully avoiding whole fat dairy products".

2. comparing raising C15 levels to those 2 studies is apples to oranges. 

- Different timescale: hours (PK spike) vs. months (steady-state).
- Different metric: peak concentration? (Cmax) vs. baseline shift.
- Different physiology: acute absorption vs. long-term balance of absorption, incorporation into membranes, metabolism, and turnover.
- Different doses: grams vs. milligrams.

"significantly greater decreases in alanine aminotransferase (−29 U/L, P = 0.001) and aspartate aminotransferase (−6 U/L, P = 0.014), as well as a greater increase in hemoglobin (0.60 g/dL, P = 0.010), as compared with participants that did not reach a posttreatment level >5 μg/mL."

:::{.incremental}
- non-parametric (no distribution assumed)
- tells you at least 2 **distributions** (not just medians) differs from among the 3
- not which pairs differ
- Medians can mislead—shape matters. KW is based on ranks of all individual values, and it is sensitive to spread and tail behavior
- "as compared with participants that did not reach a posttreatment level >5 μg/mL" implies threshold vs (subthreshold + placebo)". This was not tested.
- Small n → unstable medians
- KW test does not adjust for baseline differences
- sorry, that's how statistics works.

::: {.notes}

in other words, look at the Table 3, AST, that AST p-value of 0.014, could be just due to the sub threshold group vs threshold, and you could read this as C:15 will improve AST in half who take it.
to be clear, for AST, we don’t know if the significant p-value is due to the difference between the Threshold vs Placebo group, or the Threshold vs Subthreshold group. 
If the significance is due to Threshold vs Subthreshold, that’d be weird, no? maybe baseline imbalance, just outlier, change?

### fatty15 on the Skeptics

::: {.smaller2}

**What the skeptics say**

::: {.fragment}

> In videos, skeptics go over two clinical trials (Robinson et al. and Chooi et al.) and incorrectly conclude that these trials were not in relevant populations and did not demonstrate efficacy. 

:::

<br>

::: {.fragment}

> Strangely, the skeptics made these statements while showing the papers' abstracts, where the authors themselves concluded that C15:0 demonstrated promising results.<br>

:::

<br>


::: {.fragment}

> The skeptics do not mention any of the other five studies and four clinical trials provided above, in part because two are recent publications.

:::

:::

::: {.notes}

Maybe they don't mention them because the first 2 are not about C15:0 or fatty15, 5th literally states nothing to see here, 6th is about high vs adequate dairy diets (that happen to contain C15), 7th is weak study on skin, which probably isn't due to C15.

### So Many Claims:

:::{.smaller_large_table}

- **"Essential fatty acid" / widespread deficiency**  
  **Not supported:** C15:0 is *not* recognized as essential by authorities.
  Sources: [NIH ODS (EFAs = LA & ALA)](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcids-HealthProfessional/), [Company blog](https://fatty15.com/blogs/news/cellular-fragility-syndrome-a-deep-dive-on-nutritional-c15-0-deficiencies-and-how-to-fix-them)     
  The 3 authors of the [study claijmming this](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64960-y) are: Founder of [fatty15](https://fatty15.com/pages/stephanie-venn-watson?srsltid=AfmBOorIZisPOWXcPjqreyqn_8XFgUwoe7vfdvlfgTorI0r6n9u9X4lN), [financed by Epitracker \(Venn-Watson owned company\)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64960-y#ethics), and a

- **“Cellular Fragility Syndrome”**  
  **Not supported:** Not a recognized medical diagnosis (absent from [ICD-11](https://icd.who.int/), not a [MeSH](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/) descriptor). The term is introduced by company-affiliated authors in a single hypothesis/review and amplified in marketing/press; there is **no independent clinical validation or diagnostic criteria**. See the hypothesis paper ([Venn-Watson 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39057678/)), company blog ([fatty15](https://fatty15.com/blogs/news/cellular-fragility-syndrome-a-deep-dive-on-nutritional-c15-0-deficiencies-and-how-to-fix-them)), and third-party critique ([CSPI](https://www.cspi.org/article/fatty15-worth-hype)).

- **Metabolic health (PPAR-α/δ, AMPK, mitochondria)**  
  **Not supported (human RCTs):** 12-wk placebo-controlled trials raised blood C15:0 but **no between-group improvements** in clinical endpoints except small LDL decrease (1/37), and very very weak "subgroup" analysis for lower AST/ALT.   
  Sources: [J Nutr RCT (2024)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39069269/)

- **Heart health (LDL; cardiometabolic risk/events)**  
  **Neutral/insufficient:** No trials show fewer CVD events; observational meta-analysis shows **no association with all-cause mortality** and non-significant pooled associations for some CVD subtypes for 15:0.  
  Sources: [PLOS Med meta-analysis (2021)](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003763)

- **Liver health (enzymes; fatty liver)**  
  **Not supported (human):** 12 week human RCT trial showed no difference in liver Fat, or liver enzymes (except GGT, (but not in subgroup, lower ALT/AST in subgroup)) Unclear results (placebo increased GGT). 
  Sources: [J Nutr RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39069269/), [AJCN TANGO RCT (2024)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38035997/)

- **Red blood cells (membranes; hemoglobin)**  
  **Neutral (human ITT):** Hemoglobin increase seen only in **NON-RANDOM subgroup**, not vs placebo in intention-to-treat.  
  Source: [J Nutr RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39069269/)

- **Immune health / inflammation (cytokines, CRP)**  
  **Not supported (human):** No human RCT showing reductions; both human RCTs showed no difference in CRP in C15 group.  

- **Cognitive & mental health (dopamine/PPAR; mood/stress)**  
  **Insufficient (human):** No human trials located; claims are marketing. RCT they claim supports this (not RCT, secondary anlaysis of RCT), authors state "The present study cannot conclude that the group receiving C+15:0 together with the MD had effects in decreasing symptoms."

### So Many Claims:


:::{.smaller_large_table}


- **Sleep quality**  
  **Insufficient (human):** No C15:0 sleep RCTs; “deeper sleep” appears in marketing/surveys. RCT found do difference in sleep duration.
  Example claim: [Product page](https://fatty15.com/products/your-essential-fatty-acid)

- **Hunger/satiety (PPAR-α)**  
  **Insufficient (human):** No RCTs measuring appetite/energy intake/GLP-1/ghrelin.  
  Example claim: [Company post](https://fatty15.com/blogs/news/healthy-body-healthy-mind-how-our-bodies-use-c15-0-to-make-the-second-ever-discovered-full-acting-endocannabinoid)

- **Joint comfort**  
  **Insufficient (human):** No human RCTs on joint pain/function.  
  Example claim: [Marketing copy](https://fatty15.com/blogs/news/fatty15-near-term-benefits-and-long-term-gains)

- **Gut microbiome**  
  **Limited/neutral (human):** In NAFLD (TABGO) trial, *Bifidobacterium adolescentis* increase reported with C15:0, but **no broader microbiome “health” or clinical GI benefits** established.  
  Source: [AJCN TANGO RCT](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38035997/)

- **Anti-aging / “slows and reverses aging”**  
  **Not supported (human outcomes):** No trials on aging endpoints or epigenetic clocks; mortality association for 15:0 is **null** in meta-analysis.  
  Sources: [PLOS Med meta-analysis](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003763), [Homepage claim](https://fatty15.com/), [“Reversing cellular aging” blog](https://fatty15.com/blogs/news/reversing-cellular-aging-with-fatty15)

- **"Reduces mTOR" (longevity mechanism)**  
  **Insufficient (human):** Based on mechanistic/cell work, not human outcomes.  
  Sources: [Company mTOR blog](https://fatty15.com/blogs/news/what-it-mtor-link-to-longevity), [Review asserting AMPK↑/mTOR↓](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10649853/) is written by author and of questionable relevance.

- **"3× more cellular benefits than EPA (omega-3)" / "take fatty15 instead of omega-3"**  
  **Not supported (human); potentially misleading—arguably *borderline unethical*.** The "3×" figure comes incorrect math from a single **in-vitro** screen by company-affiliated authors; there are NO **human RCTs** or animal RCTs showing clinical superiority over EPA. Substitution messaging (implying you should take fatty15 **instead of** omega-3) conflicts with established recommendations that EPA/DHA remain important nutrients. Comparative health claims promoting substitution away from EPA/DHA **conflicts with consensus guidance** and, without competent and reliable human evidence, should be backed by **competent and reliable scientific evidence**, typically well-controlled human trials—which is not present here, a concern under [FTC health-claims standards](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Health-Products-Compliance-Guidance.pdf).
